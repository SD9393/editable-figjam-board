## Tips for Team Collaboration

### ✅ DO:
- Use descriptive project names
- Keep subtasks specific and actionable
- Tag relevant teammates on projects
- Update status regularly
- Add notes for context

### ❌ DON'T:
- Delete other people's projects without discussion
- Leave status as "To do" for active work (change to "In progress")
- Forget to assign owners - TBD projects get lost!

## Priority Levels Explained

- **P0** (Red) - Critical, immediate attention required
- **P1** (Orange) - High priority, this quarter
- **P2** (Yellow) - Medium priority, next quarter
- **P3** (Green) - Low priority, nice to have
- **P4** (Blue) - Future consideration
- **Custom Rows** (Purple/Teal) - Your custom categories like "Backlog" or "Planning"

## Sidebar Navigation 🗂️

Use the left sidebar to:
- **Quick Jump**: Click any project name to instantly scroll to that card
- **Drag to Reorder**: Reorder projects within their priority level
- **Visual Dividers**: See color-coded priority sections (P0-P4)
- **Toggle View**: Use the arrows to show/hide the sidebar

## Need Help?

- Check who last edited a card if something looks wrong
- Your name shows in the toolbar - make sure it's correct!

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see updates from teammates**  
A: Refresh your browser. Check your internet connection.

**Q: How do I change my name?**  
A: Clear your browser cache or use incognito mode, then re-enter your name.

**Q: Can I undo a change?**  
A: Currently no - changes are immediate. Be careful with deletes!

**Q: What if two people edit at once?**  
A: Last save wins. Changes sync in milliseconds so conflicts are rare.
